# Ridgeline

## [Check out my portfolio](https://www.dannysportfolio.net/)

## Description
Ridgeline is a fictional winter clothing e-store. Images and icons are made by and provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/). This is currently only a wireframe and was created using [Figma.com](figma.com). The webpage depicted is the "Product Details" page which allows the user to get the details of a particular product they may wish to purchase.
